#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It simply involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. The importance of software engineering in the technology industry incluse: enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:

- Development of programming languages like C which has been used to build some of the most used operating systems today.
- The rise of agile methodologies which is simply an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s which since then has birthed many of the software applications we have available now and solve countless issues from agriculture, education, technology to healthcare.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of Software Development Life Cycle include:

- Requirements: which is simply the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements.
- Design: which is simply creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
- Implementation: which is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
- Testing: which is conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment: which is releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: which is providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall methodology is a sequential process which means projects are divided into distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment while Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental process which means that projects are broken down into smaller, manageable work cycles called sprints.
- Waterfall methodology is a linear flow which means each phase must be completed before the next one can begin while Agile methodology deals with continuous feedback where the team iterates on the project, gathering feedback at regular intervals.
- Waterfall methodology lay emphasis on planning and documentation which means detailed requirements and specifications are created upfront while Agile methodology may have requirements changing as the project progresses
- Waterfall methodology has fixed scope and deadlines which means the project scope and timeline are predetermind and rarely change while Agile methodology is flexible which means project scope and timeline can be adjusted  based on the feedback and changing requirements.
- Waterfall methodology deals with detailed planning while Agile methodology deals with less planning.
- Waterfall methodology does not easily accommodate changes in requirements while Agile methodology can easily accommodate changes in reuirements.
- Waterfall methodology is suitable for stable projects that is, projects with well-defined requirements and a known scope while Agile methodology is not suitable for all projects especially ones with complex dependencies or critical safety requirements.
- Waterfall methodology deals with projects having well defined requirements and a stable scope, projects with a low risk of change and projects where detailed planning and documentation are essential while Agile methodology handles projects with changing requirements or uncertain scope, projects where customer feedback is crucial and projects that require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability.
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
- Quality Assurance Engineer ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project Mananger oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples of IDEs include: Visual Studio code, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
- Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples of VCS include: Git, subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The challenges faced by software engineers include: changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt while strategies for overcoming challenges incluse effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software
- Integration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
- System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models include:
- By refining prompts, we can reduce the need for multiple queries or iterations, strealining communication with the AI models.
- Prompt engineering can help mitigate bias in AI models by ensuring equal representation of different perspectives and avoiding leading or discriminatory language.
- Effective prompt engineering can create a more seamless and intuitive user experience by providing clear instructions and guiding users towards desired outcomes.
- Well designed prompts provide the AI models with clear instructions and context, resulting in more accurate and relevant responses.
- By carefully crafting prompts, you can direct the AI models towards specific responses, topics, or wriing styles.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:

Write a poem about nature.

Improved Prompt:

Write a free-verse poem that captures the serene beauty of a tranquil forest, conveying the rustling of leaves, the scent of blooming wildflowers, and the gentle songs of birds.

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

    Clear: It specifies the type of poem desired (free-verse) and provides a clear focus on the content (tranquil forest, specific sensory details).
    Specific: It narrows down the topic to a specific setting (forest) and provides details about sensory experiences (rustling leaves, wildflowers, bird songs).
    Concise: It uses brief, precise language that effectively conveys the desired poem's characteristics.
    Flexibility: While the improved prompt provides specific guidelines, it also leaves room for creative interpretation, allowing the writer to explore their unique perspective within the given framework.
